# cloud-nanodegree-final-project
Approach: __Serverless__

An ecommerce must have a product registration service API.
This project allows an API logged user to manage their product list.

the endpoints provided are located in [Products-Service AWS.postman_collection](https://github.com/fthiagomedeiros/cloud-nanodegree-final-project/blob/dev/docs/screenshots/Products-Service%20AWS.postman_collection.json)

The requests must follow the validations provided as JSONSchemas located in [validator folder](https://github.com/fthiagomedeiros/cloud-nanodegree-final-project/tree/dev/docs/screenshots/products-service/validator)
These validations only are provided to the backend and not provided at React Frontend built.
